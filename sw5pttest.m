%  1. essential matrix is singular
eq(1) = det(E);

%  2. essential matrix "trace" constrain - two singular values are equal
%  and one zero (note that this constrain ensures essential matrix
%  sinularity too. However, adding the equation comming from determinant 
%  causes that generator does not need to generate new polynomials in order
%  to find solution.
